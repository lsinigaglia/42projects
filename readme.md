# 42 Projects by Luca Sinigaglia
Welcome to my repository of 42 projects! This repository is a collection of various coding projects that I've completed as part of the 42 curriculum.

## About 42
42 is a unique coding school that promotes peer-to-peer learning, where students learn from each other and work together on projects. There are no teachers or classes in the traditional sense. Instead, students are given projects and must find their own path to completion.

## Projects
Here are the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **Libft**: Libft is a project that aims to recreate some standard C library functions, as well as additional utility functions that can be used in later projects.
2. **Get Next Line**: Get Next Line is a function that reads a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor. It's a useful function for parsing files or getting user input.
3. **Printf**: This project is a recreation of the printf function from the C standard library. It's a great exercise in handling variable arguments, string formatting, and memory management in C.
4. **Fractol**: Fractol is a project that explores the fascinating world of fractals. It's a graphical project where you'll create a program to render different types of fractals.
5. **Push Swap**: Push Swap is an algorithmic project. The goal is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

## Technologies Used

These projects were created using C and Makefile.
